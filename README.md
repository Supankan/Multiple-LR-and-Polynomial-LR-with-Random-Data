# Multiple Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression with Random Data

This repository contains code and resources for performing Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Polynomial Linear Regression (Poly LR) using randomly generated datasets. The code is organized into Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for ease of understanding and experimentation.

## Repository Structure

- **`GenPolyData.py`**: A Python script for generating a random polynomial dataset. This dataset simulates non-linear relationships between the features and the target variable. The generated data is saved as `polyLR_dataset.csv` in the `files/` folder.

- **`MLR_Scikit-Learn.ipynb`**: A Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to perform Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) using Scikit-learn. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using a random linear dataset. This notebook works with an external dataset, not stored in the repo.

- **`Poly_LR.ipynb`**: A Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to perform Polynomial Linear Regression (Poly LR) using Scikit-learn. It uses the polynomial dataset generated by `GenPolyData.py` to explore non-linear relationships and model fitting.

- **`files/polyLR_dataset.csv`**: The polynomial dataset generated by `GenPolyData.py`. This dataset is used in the `Poly_LR.ipynb` notebook for polynomial regression.

- **`files/randGen1.csv`**: A random dataset with linear data that was generated earlier but is not used directly in this repository's code. It serves as an additional resource for exploring linear relationships.
